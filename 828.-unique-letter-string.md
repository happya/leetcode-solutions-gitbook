# 828. Unique letter string

Two pointer. Very special.



Using a 2D array to record the last two appearance of each character. And when scan for the string, and meet a character `c`, calculate the contribution of last appeared `c`. The contribution of `c`is the number of sub-strings that uniquely contains it.

$$
count(c) = (record[i][1]-record[i][0])(i - record[i][1])
$$

So after the scan, we have to consider for those last appeared character, includes:

> characters only appeared once
>
> characters appeared many times, but the contribution of the last appeared one was not counted yet

So scan all the record, and add their contributions.
